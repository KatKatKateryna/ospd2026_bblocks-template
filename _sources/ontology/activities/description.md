## MoM workflow activity types

Activity types of the MoM flood workflow (subclasses of `mom:Geoprocessing`, itself a `prov:Activity`), candidate entries for the OSPD process-type register, plus the entity type, properties, workflow run type (`mom:WorkflowRun`) and alert levels (`mom:AlertLevels`) the MoM profile uses.

| Term | Generic operation |
|---|---|
| `mom:WatershedCellAttribution` | zonal masking (grid cells to zones) |
| `mom:PerWatershedAggregation` | zonal statistics |
| `mom:HazardScoreAccumulation` | index composition and classification |

The schema checks that a record of one of these types is a valid processing activity (`lu.rss-hydro.mom.processing-activity`).
